Project 2:

Topic: Extracting datapoints from college essays that worked.


This project will have three major components: 1. Collection 2. Analysis 3. Modeling


1. Collection: We will be collecting ~100s of college essays of students who were admitted to NYU without recording any personally identifiable information.

2. Analysis: Exploratory analysis of what makes college essays work. A detailed scheme would be decided once teams are formed and a formal proposal is drafted based on the skill sets of the team.

3. Modeling: Based on key features collected from 1. and 2. we try to come up with a non-parametric or parameteric model (based on what is observed in 2) that would give a mathematical/statistical path to writing a college essay or determining the importance of college essays in one's college application.
