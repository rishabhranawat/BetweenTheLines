Project 1:

Topic: Mining and analysis of unstructured data surrounding major political events.

This project will have three major components: 1. Selection of events 2. Mining and 3. Analysis.

1. Selection of events: Based on what events would have enough information available across a wide range of social media/research/news platforms we will narrow it down to one/two/three events based on the workforce that we are able to gather.

2. Mining: We will have to build scrapers/crawlers to get the data that we need based on the topics and sources we decide in 1. This could involve building classifiers for relevant content, text/image scraping etc.

3. Analysis: Quantitative and qualitative analysis+visualization - Depends on the data that is collected (nature/form/quantity).
